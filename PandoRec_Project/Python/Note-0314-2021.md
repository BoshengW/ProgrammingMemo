Finished in this week:
- Orgnized flask application with production structure.
- Added environment vairable into flask application with .env .flaskenv
- Added logging into flask application
- Solved import module from other directory issue
- Integrated flask application with Gunicorn gateway

# Python
#### 1. How to auto-load environment variables when run the application
-> (**simple way but not recommend**) 

```
## in CMD or linux 
export $FLASK_APP = app.py
...
flask run ## or you can use python app.py
```
-> (**use .flask & .env file**)
- prerequired: instaill python-dotenv
- **.flaskenv** file can be auto-loaded after you run command "flask run"
- **.env** file can be loaded and extracted when used **os.environ.get()** func

#### 2. A Good Code Structure for Flask Application
- use packages to containerize your application
-- A python package should include __ init __.py
- catalog your functionalities, make multiple sub-pypack to save this controller. And use **Blueprint** to merge into app.py
- create a extensions.py to load third-party api like MySQL, MongoDB ,...
- create a settings.py to load environment variables and some hardcore model or files

#### 3. Virtual Environment Programming
**Note**: when create a new project, it is a good way to use virtualenv for development.
```
# find a folder
mkdir <folder>

# install virtualenv
pip install virtualenv

# create a virtualenv
virtualenv <env-name>

# activate the venv
source <folder>/bin/activate

# deactivate
deactivate
```
