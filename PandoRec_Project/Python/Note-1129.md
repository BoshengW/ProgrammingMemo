This is first week, 奥力给!!! :facepunch:

This Project is designing a movie recommendation system website.
System Architecture:
1. Angular - frontend
2. Flask + Java - backend
3. Spark mlib - model training
4. MongoDB & Redis - database and cache
5. elasticsearch - searching engine
6. faiss: efficiently similarity searching framework - online searching
7. Data Manipulation & Analysis: Pandas, PySpark SQL
8. Dataset: MovieLens 100K (Small-scale demo) , 25M (Large-scale demo)

### 1. **How to write markdown in Github Issue** 
This is looks fine, and also you can add emoji based on this list: [https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908](url)

### Backend memo
========================================================
### 2. **Python**
### 2.1 How to sort a dictionary with value ?
Question: why to sort a key, value pair and loop this sorted dictionary.

```
"""
sorted():
1. input: should be iterable object -> dictionary, list, array, ...
2. key: optional params, like comparator in JAVA.
3. reverse: descend or acsend
"""
dict = { 'a': 1, 'b': 4, 'c': 2 }
for key in sorted(dict, key=dict.get, reverse=True):
    print(key)

    ## ouput:
    b, c, a

```

### 2.2 How to save & load dictionary as json file

**Note:** only serializable object can be save into .json, for example int64 object can be saved but int object can.

```
    import json

    dict = {'Ben': 43, 'Lucy': 21}

    ## write object into json
    with open('user.json', 'w') as fout:
        json.dump(dict, fout)
	fout.close()

	## load json file
	with open('user.json', 'r') as fout:
	    dict = json.load(fout)
	    fout.close()
```

### 2.3 How to find indices of top N maximum number in 1-D array

"""
use ndaray.argsort(), in this testcase, we find 2nd-5th maximum number indices
[::-1] is reverse the array
"""

```
import numpy as np

testcase = np.array([1,5,6,8,2,9,10,3])
print(testcase.argsort()[-5:-1][::-1])
```

### 2.4 Pandas how to top10 similar movieId related to each userId
***Note:*** this question is related to pandas groupby object operation


```

import pandas as pd

## create single index series object.
user_top10Movies = df_rating.groupby(["user_id"])["rating"].nlargest(10) 

## get index level (user_id & movie_id) from series object
user_top10Movies.index.get_level_values(1) ## 0: user_id, 1: movie_id

```

### 2.5 How is the fastest way to save numpy matrix 
***Note:*** In MovieLens 25M, the latent factor matrix is very large scale, it's impossible to online process these matrix, so need to offline process then uploda the model. So need to pre-stored matrixs in server. So what is the best and fastest way to save matrix?

1. Numpy memmap: maps big arrays into binary form (.dat). Binary file can accomplish saving data with less space than other format like txt, csv,...
	***Note: *** memmap has limit capacity < 2.5G 
2. HDF5: bigdata-ready file format like PyTables or h5py, high-capacity which can handle PB-level data.
3. Pickling: python pickle, support all kind of object (more flexible), but much slower than others.

```
import numpy as np

## save into binary files
testcase = np.zeros((4,4))
filename = "<path of file>"
fp = np.memmap(filename, dtype="float32", mode="w+", shape=testcase.shape)
fp[:] = testcase[:]
del fp ## remember to release the cache

## load binary file
fp = np.memmap(filename, dtype="float32", mode="r", shape=(4,4))


```
