### Frontend Memo - Html + CSS
========================================================
### 1. **CSS**
### 1.1 How to make two block element <div> align on same line ?
Question: to recommend movies to user on webpage, i want to make each movie as a card-content and align them on same line one by one. 

```
.card {
	/* this is style for each div card*/
	padding: 10px;
	margin-top: 20px;
	width: 20%;
	float: left; /* each div will align to left one by one*/
	margin-right: 20px; /*give gap between each div*/
}

```
***Important!!!: *** If you wanna add other element under above elements, you should remember clear this float, add this line into HTML code. else the layput will be wrong.

```
<br style="clear:both"/>

```
